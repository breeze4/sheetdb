# sheetdb

Inspired by a [talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufZpHuiyepg) at ngConf 2015 that talked about spreadsheets as a nice prototyping playground. SheetDB is a Clojure library for using Google Spreadsheets and OneDrive Sheets as a database. Useful for rapid prototyping and when you just need some data to play with while developing.
